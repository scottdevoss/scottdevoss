### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a husband, dog dad, skier, and sports enthusiast. Professionally, I bring a diverse background in sales across martech, government compliance software, and facility services. In 2023, I embraced a career shift into software engineering and am on the verge of graduating from the intensive Turing School of Software and Design.

With hands-on experience in Ruby, Ruby on Rails, APIs, SQL, Active Record, and more, I have honed my skills in designing, developing, testing, deploying, and maintaining applications. I find joy in project creation and witnessing ideas come to life. Excited to bring my unique perspective and skills into the software engineering industry!
